# NonsensicalNovelNations

This assembles playable nations, where all units, commanders, and pretender options are all non-unique units drawn at random from the game. Inspired by NationGen, but much more silly. Nations are guaranteed to have some mages, a scout, a priest, and a maximum level of path access; the rest is entirely random.

This uses an algorithm to put gold prices on all units and commanders in an attempt to make this not get too out of hand. This is what allows all the things in the game to be used, as a price can be put on things that are not generally recruitable such as pretender monster chassis, horrors, elementals, national heroes, and more.

There are no attempts here to maintain a consistent race, theme, or mythological/historical setting. For those who are interested in this, NationGen is probably a more appropriate tool.

Current todo list:

Write autocalc for unit base resources
Write autocalc for weapon base resources
Write autocalc for armour base resources
Allow loading and inclusion of modded units
